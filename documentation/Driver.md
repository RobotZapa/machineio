# Creating a driver/protocol
If you wish to write a driver or protocol.

### Start with the test.py code.
The test.py code is a working skeleton of the code you will write.

### Network Code
The network client is thread/asyncio independent, so there is no need to worry how that is done!
It uses multiprocessing and queues to where the network is handled.
