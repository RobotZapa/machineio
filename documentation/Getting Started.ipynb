    "A functor is a class who's objects are meant to be called like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why not just functions?\n",
    "Functions are great! Simple and effective. But having a entire library of functions with oddly specific names that require you to put in what pin you want to perfom the action every time gets tiresome and is hard to read. Also, if you change how a pin works you might have to change it a throughout your code.\n",

    "#### Why not just classes?\n",
    "Classes are good but end up getting complex and messy once the code gets too big. This gets extra bad in python because you might want to access members as well as functions for this or that."
